    "### Question 1\n",
    "The number of customers in a supermarket during lunch hour, $X$, is a non-negative, discrete random variable. The **Poisson** distribution is often used to model such a variable, and is defined by a single rate parameter $\\lambda$. The store manager wishes to estimate the number of customers to expect during lunch hour. On one particular day, they count 26 customers between 12pm and 1pm. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write down the probability density function of the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Write down the likelihood function based on your answer in part (a), given the observed data $x = 26$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Following the example from the lecture and the prompts below, calculate the likelihood for a range of values for $\\lambda$. Draw a plot of the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Identify the value of $\\lambda$ for which the probability of observing 26 customers is highest, i.e. for which the likelihood is highest. Mark it on your plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Derive the maximum likelihood estimator for $\\lambda$ algebraically, following the steps in section 5.6 of the lecture notes. Confirm that your estimate from part (d) agrees with the algebraic solution. *(remember you'll need the more general likelihood in terms of 'x' rather than the example value of 26)*"
