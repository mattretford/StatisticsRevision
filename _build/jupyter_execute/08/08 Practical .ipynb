    "Sepsis is a costly and often fatal medical condition which can affect hospitalized patients. To prevent death, it is vital to identify sepsis cases early.  There are various scores intended to measure suspicion of sepsis infection. These can be dichotomised by choosing cut-offs to classify patients into suspected sepsis and not.  We will consider the systemic inflammatory response system (SIRS) criteria to be the reference (comparison) score, and explore whether other scores do better, in terms of the proportion of sepsis cases correctly identified (the sensitivity). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider the following three scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- National and Modified Early Earning Score (NEWs), a very simple-to-apply early warning score\n",
    "- quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, also very simple-to-apply\n",
    "- eCART score, derived from a random forest algorithm including vital signs, laboratory values, and patient demographics\n",
